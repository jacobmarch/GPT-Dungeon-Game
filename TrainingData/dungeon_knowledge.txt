**Traps**
* Pitfall traps are often concealed with leaves and branches. Carefully investigating the ground might reveal signs of disturbance. Disarming a pitfall might involve finding its triggering mechanism or carefully wedging the cover open to prevent it from dropping.

**Enemies**
* Goblins are often armed with crude but dangerous weapons like rusty swords. They rely on surprise and aggression. Blocking their attacks with a shield and aiming for quick counterattacks can be effective. Goblins are not particularly intelligent and are easily distracted.

**Friendly Characters**
* Wizards are fonts of knowledge and possess some magical abilities. They may offer guidance, magical items, or direct assistance. Requests should be clear and concise.  A wise wizard's aid often aligns with the greater challenges the player might face later in their journey.
